variable,description,,,,,,,
Treatment,"composition of amphibian host assemblage (B = Anaxyrus boreas, G = Taricha granulosa, P = Pseudacris regilla, R = Rana catesbeiana, T = Taricha torosa)",,,,,,,
HostRichness,number of amphibian host species included,,,,,,,
HostCount,number of host individuals per microcosm,,,,,,,
Parasite,species of parasite,,,,,,,
Count,number of parasite metacercariae detected among all individual hosts,,,,,,,*RR: I think this is the desirability index that you're trying to predict?? 
TotalAdded,number of infectious parasites (cercariae) added initially,,,,,,,
B,presence/absence of species B,,,,,,,
P,presence/absence of species P,,,,,,,
R,presence/absence of species R,,,,,,,
G,presence/absence of species G,,,,,,,
T,presence/absence of species T,,,,,,,
CommFreq,"the community frequency of each host assemblage, as determined from field surveys; for each richness level (1, 2 or 4), this value is the proportion of empirical observations matching this composition",,,,,,,
